        The AWS and DevOps course has two main modules. Increase your ability to
        deliver applications quickly by learning services in AWS. Enhance your
        tech skills by learning DevOps tools. Our AWS and DevOps training
        prepare you for AWS & DevOps certifications. Cloud computing is the
        on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet. Many businesses
        today need secure data processing and management platforms. Cloud
        computing service providers offer reasonable solutions to these needs
        such as content delivery, database storage, and much more. Rather than
        owning their own computing infrastructure or data centers, companies can
        rent access to many resources ranging from applications to storage via a
        cloud service provider like AWS.
